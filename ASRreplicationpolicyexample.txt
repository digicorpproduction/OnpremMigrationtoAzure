ASR replication policy example:

This PowerShell script creates a replication policy named "MyReplicationPolicy" with the following settings:

RecoveryPointRetentionRangeInHours: The number of hours for which recovery points are retained. In this example, recovery points are retained for 24 hours.

ApplicationConsistentSnapshotFrequencyInHours: The frequency at which application-consistent snapshots are taken. In this example, application-consistent snapshots are taken every 4 hours.

InitialReplicationDurationInHours: The time window for the initial replication of the server to Azure. In this example, the initial replication takes 24 hours.

You can adjust these settings to meet your specific requirements. For example, if you need to retain recovery points or application-consistent snapshots for a longer period of time, you can increase these values.

Once you have created the replication policy, you can use it to enable replication for your on-premise server. Here is an example of how to enable replication for an on-premise server using the replication policy:

powershell
Copy code
# Enable replication for your server
$ServerArgs = @{
    Name = "server1"
    IPAddress = "10.0.0.3"
    ProtectionContainerMapping = (Get-AzureRmSiteRecoveryProtectionContainerMapping -VaultContext $VaultContext -ProtectionContainer $ProtectionContainerName).ID
    ReplicationPolicy = (Get-AzureRmSiteRecoveryPolicy -Name $ReplicationPolicyName).ID
}
Enable-AzureRmSiteRecoveryProtection -InputObject $ServerArgs
This PowerShell script enables replication for an on-premise server named "server1" with IP address "10.0.0.3" using the replication policy named "MyReplicationPolicy". Once replication is enabled, the on-premise server will start replicating to Azure based on the settings specified in the replication policy.

Remember to replace the placeholder values in the script with your actual values. For example, replace "server1" with the name of your server and "10.0.0.3" with your server's IP address.
